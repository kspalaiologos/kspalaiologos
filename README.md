### Hello!

I'm Palaiologos and I'm a mathematician, array lang & low level developer. My interests include chess, reverse-engineering (trying to make it harder in particular), C, C++, x86 assembly, Perl, the JVM, functional programming and APL. I do compiler construction fairly often. Reach out to me at:
