### Hello!

Hello! I'm Kamila Szewczyk, I'm 19 and I usually go under the online moniker Palaiologos.
I'm an expert programmer and aspiring mathematician, primarily interested in compiler construction, data compression, esoteric languages, statistics and numerical algorithms. Additionally, during my teens I have possessed substantial knowledge of low level development and performance optimisation.
