### Hello!

I'm Palaiologos (she/her) and I'm a mathematician, array lang & low level developer. My interests include chess, reverse-engineering (trying to make it harder in particular), C, C++, x86 assembly, Perl, the JVM, functional programming and APL. I do compiler construction fairly often. Reach out to me at:

- https://t.me/kspalaiologos
- https://twitter.com/realpalaiologos
- Matrix (preferred): kamila@coven.palaiologos.rocks

### My website

I maintain a website with my small lab notebook kind of blog. You can [learn more about me](https://palaiologos.rocks/about/) there.

### Donations

I collect donations via [LiberaPay](https://liberapay.com/kspalaiologos/).

As stated on my profile, I can't provide consistent rewards for donations. Although, if you end up donating to me, make sure to message me on Matrix, Discord or Twitter (everything is on my website; pick whichever you feel comfortable with). We can always talk about any programming-related topic you'd like.

The money from donations I receive will cover both my server costs and the costs of my non-essential medical treatment.
