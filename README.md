### Hello!

I'm Palaiologos (she/her) and I'm a mathematician, array lang & low level developer. My interests include chess, reverse-engineering (trying to make it harder in particular), C, C++, x86 assembly, Perl and APL. I do compiler construction fairly often. Reach me out on:
- https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/users/61379/kamila-szewczyk
- https://t.me/kspalaiologos
- https://twitter.com/realpalaiologos
- Discord: Palaiologos#5585, or join [my server](https://discord.gg/m4Wcenn).

### My website

I maintain a website with my small lab notebook kind of blog. You can [learn more about me](https://palaiologos.rocks/about/) there.

### My presence and impact

I'm the author of the most complex Malbolge Unshackled program - a Lisp interpreter - as of 2020 (and 2021, and still going - first ever non-trivial language implemented in it). I also made the most efficient Mersenne Twister cracker allowing the recovery of initial seeds. I provided the entire algorithm overview and a reference implementation to the general public on my blog.

I also developed a 5 kilobyte decompressor (Windows `.exe`) for a compression algorithm outperforming (in terms of ratios and decompressor size) LZMA and GZip.

I'm the author of asm2bf, the most advanced brainfuck toolkit staying true to brainfuck principles and allowing to write relatively small and fast programs.

### Donations

I collect donations via [LiberaPay](https://liberapay.com/kspalaiologos/).

As stated on my profile, I can't provide consistent rewards for donations. Although, if you end up donating to me, make sure to message me on Matrix, Discord or Twitter (everything is on my website; pick whichever you feel comfortable with). We can always talk about any programming-related topic you'd like.

The money from donations I receive will cover both my server costs and the costs of my non-essential medical treatment.
